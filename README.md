# portfolio_projects
This repository acts as a link to many projects where I have applied machine learning algorithms

----------------------------------------------------
BASIC EXERCISES
---------------------------------------------------
# 1. classification evaluation metrics

In this project, I have demonstrated my understanding of various evaluation metrics for classification problems, like the precision-recall curves, roc/auc curve, confusion metrics.
- This project is just for udnerstanding the eval meterics in detail
- Dataset used is breast_cancer dataset in sklearn.datasets

# 2. Predicting Boston Housing Prices using Linear Regression

In this project I investigated the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

Implemented the model using Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression & achieved a root mean square error of 2.94

# 3. Predicting measure of disease progression one year after baseline

using the sklearn inuilt diabetes dataset, I have demonstrated the overfit, underfit issue

# 4. Implementing NaiveBayes

This project is just an exercise to understand naive bayes. I have used the in-built algorithm to get probaility values and then calcuated conditional probabilities manually to match with the former.
Dataset is dummy dataa and 80% model score is acheived in classification of this problem set

# 5. Classification on IRIS dataset

- used scatterplot to visualize the decision boundary
- Used SVC to classify with an accuracy of 96% at best 
- Use varying values for gamma and regularization

Intermediate Projects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Predicting survival of passengers on the Titanic dataset

In this project I investigated a dataset containing information about Titanic passengers by using NumPy and Pandas, which are two popular Python packages used for manipulating datasets. The goal of this project was to get acquainted with said tools, learn about the different data structures (NumPy Arrays, Series and DataFrames) they offer,and practice the key steps on the whole data analysis process.
- I have used RandomForest, SVM, NaiveBayes and Randomforest performs best with an average of 0.82 with 5 folds, with a max of 0.86
